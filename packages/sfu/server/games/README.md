# Game runtime (server-authoritative)

This is the **second app archetype** for Conclave, parallel to the collaborative
apps relay (`appsHandlers.ts` + Yjs). Where the apps relay is a dumb broadcaster
of a shared CRDT (every client converges on identical, fully-visible state), the
game runtime keeps canonical state **only on the server** and sends each client a
_projection_:

- `publicView` -> broadcast to the whole room (`game:state`)
- `playerView` -> emitted privately to a single player (`game:view`)

That split is what makes **hidden information** (secret roles, private words,
unrevealed answers) possible. A CRDT cannot hide anything from anyone.

## Pieces

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `types.ts` | `GameModule` contract, wire payloads, `GameMoveError` |
| `validation.ts` | reusable move decoders/validators (`payloadField`, `requireInt`, `requireString`, `requireOneOf`, `requirePlayerTarget`) |
| `config.ts` | option schema defaults + `normalizeConfig` for untrusted host config |
| `rng.ts` | seeded PRNG (server-only randomness for shuffles/deals) |
| `roundLoop.ts` | shared round/phase driver + `allActivePlayersActed` liveness gate (advance early against connected players, never frozen seats) |
| `aiContent.ts` | optional OpenAI generated prompt primitive |
| `engine.ts` | `GameSession` owns authoritative state, applies moves, projects views |
| `registry.ts` | maps `gameId` to module |
| `modules/*.ts` | the games themselves (pure reducers) with exported typed move unions |
| `../socket/handlers/gameHandlers.ts` | socket wiring: validation, broadcast loop, per-player emit, game votes, PostHog lifecycle analytics |
| `../analytics/posthog.ts` | opt-in server-side product analytics (enabled only when `SFU_POSTHOG_KEY` is set) |

The session/tick timer is owned by `Room` (`room.gameSession`, `room.gameTickTimer`)
and torn down in `Room.close()` via `clearGame()`.

## Socket contract

| Event | Dir | Ack | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `game:list` | c->s | yes | available games catalog (options, player bounds, leaderboard flag) |
| `game:start` | c->s | yes | admin starts a game with validated config (snapshots current participants as players); replaces a finished session, which is the rematch path |
| `game:move` | c->s | yes | a player submits a move, decoded against the module's typed move union |
| `game:end` | c->s | yes | admin ends the game |
| `game:getState` | c->s | yes | public state + your private view + active vote + `selfId` (reconnect/late join) |
| `game:state` | s->room | no | public projection on every change (includes host `config` for rematch) |
| `game:view` | s->player | no | **private** projection (hidden-info boundary) |
| `game:snapshot` | s->client | no | targeted join/reconnect snapshot: active game, private view, vote, and `selfId` |
| `game:ended` | s->room | no | game cleared |
| `game:vote:open` | c->s | yes | host opens a vote on which game to play |
| `game:vote:cast` | c->s | yes | player votes for a candidate game |
| `game:vote:cancel` | c->s | yes | host cancels the vote |
| `game:vote` | s->room | no | live vote state |

`selfId` is the caller's canonical player id. Clients must match themselves against it instead of rebuilding identity locally (email casing and session ids are normalized server-side).

## Adding a game

Full contributor guide: `packages/apps-sdk/docs/guides/add-a-game.md`.

1. Create `modules/<id>.ts` exporting a `GameModule<YourState>`:
   - `generateContent(ctx)`: optional async content loader for prompts,
     questions, or word sets. Use `generateStructuredGameContent` from
     `aiContent.ts` and validate the returned object before using it.
   - `setup(ctx)`: build initial state with `ctx.rng` (seeded) and `ctx.players`.
     Generated content is available as `ctx.content`; keep a local fallback so
     rooms still start when AI is disabled or unavailable.
   - `onMove(state, move, ctx)`: return next state; `throw new GameMoveError(...)`
     to reject. Gate admin-only moves with `ctx.isAdmin(move.playerId)`.
     Use helpers from `validation.ts` for common payload checks such as selecting
     another player.
   - `onTick(state, ctx)` + `tickMs`: for deadlines/countdowns (return the same
     reference to signal "no change").
   - `getPhase(state)`: coarse label for the host UI.
   - `publicView(state, ctx)`: **must not leak secrets**. Include `ctx.now` as
     `serverNow` if you use deadlines so clients can run a skew-free countdown.
   - `playerView(state, playerId, ctx)`: this player's private slice.
2. Register it in `registry.ts`.
3. Add a web renderer in `apps/web/src/app/components/games/` and route it in
   `apps/web/src/app/components/games/registry.tsx`. The renderer is pure
   presentation: it reads the two views and calls `move(type, payload)`. It
   holds **no** game logic.

## Current games

- `trivia`: Kahoot/Deezer-style timed quiz; speed-weighted scoring; projects
  per-player tile status (answered, correct, points) for the video-tile overlay.
- `bluff`: Fibbage-style fake-answer game.
- `would-you-rather`: room split prompts with no wrong answer.
- `most-likely-to`: player-target voting prompts; tiles are tappable ballots.
- `reaction`: server-timed reflex game.
- `imposter`: Spyfall-style social deduction; exercises the hidden-info path
  (imposter and crew receive different `playerView`s); tiles are tappable
  ballots during the accusation vote.
- `wordle`: turn-based word game with a setter/guesser split.
- `patches`: LinkedIn-style rectangle-partition puzzle raced independently by
  every player; each patch must satisfy its clue's area and shape.

Trivia, Bluff, Would You Rather, Most Likely To, and Imposter can generate fresh
content from the host's topic input when OpenAI is configured.

## Beyond the dock

Games are not limited to the docked panel. The web client binds game state to
the participant video tiles (rank chips, locked-in checks, correct washes,
winner crowns, eliminated scrims, tap-to-vote). The contract lives in the apps
SDK; see `packages/apps-sdk/docs/reference/tile-adornments.md`. Server modules
participate by exposing non-secret per-player facts in `publicView` (see
trivia's `tiles` map for the pattern).

## Analytics

When `SFU_POSTHOG_KEY` is set, `gameHandlers.ts` captures a server-side
lifecycle event per transition (`game_started`, `game_finished`, `game_ended`,
and the vote events), grouped by room, with a per-play instance id. No player
names or user content are ever sent; the free-text topic reduces to a
`has_topic` boolean. With no key set, nothing is constructed or sent.

## OpenAI content

The primitive uses the official OpenAI TypeScript SDK and Responses API with
strict JSON-schema Structured Outputs. This is intentionally a runtime
capability, not a patch inside one game:

- modules opt in with `generateContent`
- socket handlers stay generic
- JSON schema constrains the model response
- each module still validates and sanitizes the object
- local banks remain as fallbacks

Config:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
SFU_GAME_AI_TIMEOUT_MS=25000
SFU_GAME_AI_ENABLED=1
SFU_GAME_AI_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED=1
SFU_GAME_AI_WEB_SEARCH_CONTEXT_SIZE=low
```

The model is centrally fixed to `gpt-5.6-luna` in the SFU configuration. The
same server-side `OPENAI_API_KEY` is shared with other OpenAI-backed SFU
capabilities and is never sent to clients.

Web search is enabled by default through the Responses API `web_search` tool.
The default context size is `low` to keep game startup responsive. Responses
are not stored by OpenAI, and every generated object is constrained by the
game's strict JSON schema and then validated again by the game module.

Live smoke test:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... pnpm -C packages/sfu run test:game-ai
```

## Known gaps / next

- Seats are still snapshotted at start: a disconnected player keeps their seat,
  score, and results-board row, and a late joiner can only watch. Round
  progression no longer stalls on absentees (liveness gates run against
  `ctx.activePlayers` via `allActivePlayersActed`), but there is no "join next
  round" path yet.
- One game per room at a time (mirrors the single-`activeAppId` apps model).
- Authoritative state lives only in memory; an SFU restart kills a live game
  with no recovery snapshot.
- Tile binding is visual and vote-input only so far; phase-based mute and
  spotlight driving is still open.
